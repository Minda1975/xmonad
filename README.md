ATENTION!

Complete rewrite!

# xmonad
What is Xmonad? It is a tiling window manager that is notoriously minimal, stable, beautiful, and featureful. If you find yourself spending a lot of time organizing or managing windows, you may consider trying xmonad. Xmonad can be somewhat difficult to configure if you're new to Haskell or even to Xmonad itself. This project contains a completely working and very usable xmonad configuration "out of the box". If you are just starting out with Xmonad, this will give you a configuration that I personally use for around 8 hours every day. Thought has been put into the colors, key bindings, layouts, and supplementary scripts to make life easier. This config fit with xmonad ver 12. 

All Xmonad configuration is in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs. This includes things like key bindings, colors, layouts, etc. You may need to have some basic understanding of Haskell in order to modify this file, but most people have no problems. Configuration file for xmobar is in ~/.xmonad. Xmobar is configured to show date and time, mem usage, cpu usage, cpu temp, current keyboard layout, volume (separate script) and uptime.

All scripts are in ~/.scripts. Scripts are provided to do things like take screenshots, (i use scrot, slop and viewnior) , mpd status in xmobar (gets the currently playing song from MPD) . 

P.S.

My font is Fantasque Sans Mono Nerd Font. You can find it in .font dir. Also check these [Nerd-Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and get acquainted with the details.  It have 40+ patched fonts, over 3,600 glyph/icons, includes popular collections such as Font Awesome & fonts such as Hack. Worth to try it!
My shell is zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework.

Also, i put configs for mpd, ncmpcpp (a simple ncmpcpp config, with album art support. To use ncmpcpp with album art, simply launch ncmpcpp -c /home/yourusername/.config/ncmpcpp/config-art-dark. Urxvt with pixbuf enabled is needed. Also integrated with dunst notification. Just copy my dunst config, install dunst, and do nothing. Dunst will launch automatically if triggered by notify-send event), xresources (my configuration for URxvt, including copy paste support. Hit Alt+C to copy, and Alt+V to paste (xsel package is needed). I put the colour configuration in ~/.xrdb folder and include it in Xresources using #include command. It makes me able to change or mix the colour scheme for urxvt and rofi easily. You will understand if you look at it. All of my favourite terminal colour scheme i frequently use on my setup is available in ~/.xrdb/color folder), scrot+viewnior (a simple script to take screenshoot using scrot, then add date to the file name, then open the result instantly using Viewnior), urxvt (draw a floating URxvt), rofi (rofi colour is set in ~/.Xresources, but it just an #INCLUDE command. The actual colour configuration is in ~/.xrdb/rofi. You will understand if you look at it. And the launch configuration is in .fvwm/cripts dir


In this repo you will find Gtk2/3 themes (Fantome, Lumiere, Noita, Ocha, Tee and Vestica) and icons (Arc, Canta, ePapirus, Numix, Numix-Circle, Numix-Circle-Light, Numix-Light, Papirus, Papirus-Adapta, Papirus-Adapta-Nokto, Papirus-Dark and Papirus-Light). These themes and icons are very relevant to the overall picture.
