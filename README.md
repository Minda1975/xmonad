# xmonad
This is a fork of frank604 Xmonad, with modified for my personal needs. What is Xmonad? It is a tiling window manager that is notoriously minimal, stable, beautiful, and featureful. If you find yourself spending a lot of time organizing or managing windows, you may consider trying xmonad. Xmonad can be somewhat difficult to configure if you're new to Haskell or even to Xmonad itself.This project contains a completely working and very usable xmonad configuration "out of the box". If you are just starting out with Xmonad, this will give you a configuration that I personally use for around 8 hours every day. Thought has been put into the colors, key bindings, layouts, and supplementary scripts to make life easier. This config fit with xmonad ver 12. 

All Xmonad configuration is in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs. This includes things like key bindings, colors, layouts, etc. You may need to have some basic understanding of Haskell in order to modify this file, but most people have no problems. Configuration file for xmobar is in ~/.xmonad. Xmobar is configured to show date and time, mem usage, cpu usage, cpu temp, current keyboard layout, volume (separate script) and uptime.

All scripts are in ~/.scripts. Scripts are provided to do things like take screenshots, start dmenu, browsing files with dmenu, browsing mpd playlist, play it and power menagment with dmenu (poweroff, reboot, lock the screen etc.). Also i included fonts which apply my Xmonad setup and wallpapers which I created myself.

Also, i made minimall Xmonad config for those who appreciate minimalism.
